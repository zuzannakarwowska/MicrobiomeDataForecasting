# MicrobiomeDataForecasting

This repo contains code used during developement of th project 'PREDICTIONG MICROBIOME CHANGE IN TIME AND UPON PERTURBATION' funded by Polish National Science Centre Grant.

Bacteria in the gut microbiome form a dynamic milieu due to their interactions with the host, the environment, and most importantly with each other. However, most of the research on the gut microbiome uses cross-sectional data to find differences in microbiome composition between groups. This ignores the importance of the dynamic changes in the microbiome and makes the analysis of causality and dynamic interactions between bacteria impossible. 

Here, we used a statistical framework in order to understand the dynamic interactions within the healthy human gut microbiome and to what extent we are able to predict it. 

In this project we answer questions such as: how bacteria interact with each other in time?
* are interactions between bacteria unique for a host or similar between subjects?
* to what extent gut microbiome is self-explainable?
* are interactions within a phylogenetic/taxonomic group stronger?
* which bacteria are the main drivers of the gut microbiome community?

We believe that our results and subsequent work will help us to better understand the dynamic interactions within the human gut microbiome.

In the future, they can be used in microbiome-based personalized therapy where we can plan in advance how to model microbiome changes and anticipate diseases originating from dysbiosis or manipulate microbiome composition.
